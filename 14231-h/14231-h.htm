    <h2>A QUEER CHRISTMAS PARTY.</h2>

    <p>I remember coming home and dressing to go out again. Of this
    so far I am sure. I remember too taking a cab; also the cab
    taking me. But oddly enough though I dined that evening with a
    very old friend, somehow I cannot for the life of me, at this
    moment, call to mind his name or remember where he lives.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/301.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/301.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>However, the evening was so remarkable that I at once sat
    down next day to record all that I could remember of this
    strange Christmas Party. Round the table were ROBERT ELSMERE,
    DORIAN GRAY, Sir ALAN QUATERMAIN, the MASTER of BALLANTREE, and
    other distinguished persons, including Princess
    NAPRAXINE,&mdash;a charming woman, who looked remarkably well
    in her white velvet with a knot of old lace at her throat and a
    tea-rose in her hair. Mrs. HAWKSBEE, too, looked smart in black
    satin, but in my opinion she was cut out by little DAISY
    MILLER, a sprightly young lady from America. My host (I wish I
    could remember his name) carried his love of celebrities so
    far, that even his servants were persons of considerable
    notoriety. His head butler, a man named MULVANEY, was an old
    soldier, who, with the two footmen (formerly his
    companions-in-arms) had been known in India by the name of
    "Soldiers Three."</p>

    <p>"It was so good of you to come, although your husband had
    Russian influenza," remarked our host to ANNA KARENINA, who was
    seated on his left.</p>

    <p>"My dear friend," she replied, "I was only too delighted;
    for really my husband cracks his finger-joints so much more
    lately, and it makes me so nervous, that I often think, if it
    were not that Mr. WRONGSKY sometimes calls on my day at home, I
    am sure I should be bored to death!"</p>

    <p>"Ah! I know what that is!" said HEDDA GABLER, nodding
    sympathetically. "My husband, when he heard I wanted to come
    to-day, said 'Fancy that!' and I really felt I could have
    thrown something at him. They are so irritating," she added,
    with a glance at THÉRÈSE RAQUIN who was sitting very silent at
    the other end of the table softly caressing a fruit-knife.</p>

    <p>"Ah!" sighed DORIAN GRAY, as he dipped his white taper
    fingers in a red copper bowl of rose-water. "I have had an
    exquisite life. I have drunk deeply of everything. I have
    crushed the grapes against my palate. And it has all been to me
    no more than the sound of music. It has not marred me. I am still
    the same. More so, if anything."</p>

    <p>"I think we ought to understand one another, perhaps, Mr.
    GRAY," said ROBERT ELSMERE, with a quick sense of oppression.
    "I know your opinions of course from your books. You know what
    mine as an honest man must be. My conscience forbids me to
    discuss anything."</p>

    <p>"My dear ELSMERE," returned DORIAN, "don't deceive yourself.
    Life is not governed by Will or Intention. Life has been my
    Art. I have set myself to music. My days have been my sonnets,
    and it has not hurt me. I am as good-looking as ever." And with
    his cool, flower-like hands, and his charming boyish smile, he
    lit a gold-tipped cigarette, offering one to Princess
    NAPRAXINE.</p>

    <p>She refused it, but produced a cigar-case, embroidered with
    the arms of the NAPRAXINES, from which she took a very large
    cigar.</p>

    <p>"I should like to take that fellow out on the river with
    me," muttered one of the boating trio to his friends.</p>

    <p>"And drown him," said another.</p>

    <p>"Or set MONTMORENCY at him," said the third.</p>

    <p>These Three Men, who, on their arrival, had been rather
    bashful, had become, during the process of demolishing the
    Christmas pudding with fire-brandy sauce, to which they helped
    themselves plentifully, the most cheerful of all the company.
    They talked and laughed loudly, alluded to Mr. ELSMERE as "Old
    Square-toes"; and made no more disguise of the evident
    admiration with which Mrs. HAWKSBEE had inspired them, than
    they did of the violent dislike they had conceived for Mr.
    GRAY.</p>

    <p>They were growing less and less able to control their
    actions, and I was not sorry when the time arrived for the
    ladies to retire, which they did rather earlier than they had
    intended doing, owing to a sudden display of ill-temper on the
    part of DIANA of the Crossways. They all withdrew, with the
    exception of the Princess, who, alleging that it was a Russian
    custom, remained with us, smoking, and drinking kümmel out of a
    Samovar. Immediately upon the departure of the ladies, ROBERT
    ELSMERE resumed his argument.</p>

    <p>"I have not," he said, in a low tone, "rooted up the most
    sacred growths of life as a careless child devastates his
    garden."</p>

    <p>"I have never yet heard of a DURRISDEER who was a turn-coat
    or a spy," remarked the MASTER of BALLANTREE, casually.</p>

    <p>"Ah! but that is another story," objected Colonel GADSBY,
    stroking his long moustache.</p>

    <p>"I can believe anything," said DORIAN GRAY, "as long as it
    is quite incredible."</p>

    <p>"Oh! Then you'd believe that story old BATT, the fisherman,
    told us about the pike at Goring!" said one of the trio, with a
    contemptuous laugh.</p>

    <p>And here we come to the unfortunate incident which broke up
    our party. I shall always blame the Princess for this. If she
    had gone to the drawing-room with the other ladies, it would
    never have happened. It appears that she considered herself
    insulted by a remark of DORIAN's, which I thought innocent
    enough. I think it was, that "All Art is quite useless."</p>

    <p>Why she should have taken this so personally&mdash;whether
    she thought he was alluding to her Narcissus-like complexion,
    or her wealth of luminous hair&mdash;I cannot say. At any
    rate&mdash;though I would not have it even whispered to poor
    little JIM, who, being far from well, had been quite unable to
    leave his sofa,&mdash;I say, at any rate, I, for one, felt
    convinced that the Princess had taken quite as much kümmel as
    was good for her, otherwise, how could any one, except my old
    friend ALICE DE VONDERLAND account for her urging the Three
    Men, already far gone, to go still farther, and to "Protect her
    honour," as she termed it, "by wiping out the insult offered to
    the NAPRAXINES!"</p>

    <p>The Three Men took the suggestion literally. A wild scene
    ensued. Shouting wildly, "We'll spoil your beauty for you!" one
    tore the flower out of DORIAN's coat, another threw the red
    copper bowl of rose-water at his head, a third, with the
    uncommonly vulgar exclamation, "Art be blowed! we'll show you
    some science!" struck the unfortunate man a violent blow on the
    nose with his clenched fist.</p>

    <p>How the scene might have ended but for the sudden
    intervention of MULVANEY and his companions, I cannot say. In
    the strangest dialect, and with the most uncouth oaths, they
    literally "went for" the Three Boating Men. The aquatic
    champions were completely demolished by the Soldiers Three.</p>

    <p>In the words of the butler, "Their shirt-fronts were
    crumpled 'orrid." The three youths, in a pitiable state, left
    the house with the Princess, and went off all together in a
    droschki, the driver of which wore a badge on which was
    inscribed, "JOSEF HATTONSKI. By Order of the CZAR." DORIAN had
    already escaped, bearing on his handsome countenance the
    impress of fists and the stains of flattened mince-pies.</p>

    <p>For my own part ... I don't know how I managed to get away.
    I suppose I must have been rendered insensible by a candlestick
    which was thrown at me. At all events, I found myself on the
    floor, having tumbled out of bed ... But how I had ever got to
    bed I do not remember. It may be I shall never discover the
    truth of it all. Stay!&mdash;had I been hypnotised? If so,
    when, where, and by whom?</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>AN ANTI-HISS-TRIONIC BIRD.</h3>

    <p>A "PAR" in the <i>Daily News</i> last Thursday told how the
    Antipodæans had presented Miss NELLIE FARREN with "a Laughing
    Jackass." What a time he'll have of it! Always in fits, and
    perhaps the merry bird will at last "die o' laughin'"! For it
    is a biped and not a quadruped; not that as a biped "the
    Laughing Jackass" is by any means a <i>lusus naturæ</i>. This
    bird, not probably unfamiliar with the "'Oof Bird" of sporting
    circles, is, it is said, "a foe to snakes." Excellent omen this
    for Miss FARREN. Laughter everywhere, and no hissing permitted.
    If hissing heard anywhere, up starts the Laughing Jackass and
    down he comes on the snake, and there's an end of the hissing.
    Theatrical Managers would do well to cultivate the Laughing
    Jackasses, and keep a supply always on the premises.</p>

        Railway Station to the Hotel Dandolo, Venice. The gondola
        is gliding with a gentle sidelong heave under shadowy
        bridges of stone and cast-iron, round sharp corners, and
        past mysterious blank walls, and old scroll-work gateways,
        which look ghostly in the moonlight</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> For rest, see guide-books, <i>passim</i>, eh?
    Hanged if <i>I</i> can see; any structures with this thing on,

    <p><i>Culch.</i> He probably imagines you are merely expressing
    your satisfaction with Venice. And I don't see how you expect
    him to remove the entire cabin here! (PODBURY <i>crawls in
    again, knocking his head.</i>) I think we did well to let
    the&mdash;the others travel on first. More <i>dignified</i>,
    you know!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Um&mdash;don't see any particular dignity in
    missing the train, myself!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> They won't know it was not intentional. And I
    think, PODBURY, we should go on&mdash;er&mdash;asserting
    ourselves a little while by holding rather aloof. It will show
    them that we don't mean to put up with&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Don't see that either. Not going to let that
    beast, VAN BOODELER have it <i>all</i> his own way!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Surely you know he decided suddenly to stay at
    Vicenza? He said so at breakfast. But I will <i>not</i> have
    your friend BOB perpetually&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> At breakfast? Oh, I came down late. Vicenza,
    eh? Then <i>he</i>'s out of it! Hooray! But as for BOB,
    <i>he</i>'s all right too. Oh, I forgot you cut
    <i>déjeuner</i>. HYPATIA had another squabble with Miss
    TROTTER, and poor old BOB got dragged into it as usual, and now
    they ain't on speaking terms.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>overjoyed</i>). You don't say so! Then all
    <i>I</i> can say, PODBURY, is that if we two can't manage, in a
    place like this, to recover all the ground we have
    lost&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> More water than ground in a place like this,
    eh? But <i>I</i> know what you mean&mdash;we <i>must</i> be
    duffers if we don't leave Venice engaged men&mdash;which we're
    not as yet, worse luck!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> No&mdash;but we <i>shall</i> be, if we only
    insist upon being treated seriously.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> She treats me a devilish deal <i>too</i>
    seriously, my boy. But there, never mind&mdash;things will go
    better now!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Lighting a "fidibus." Splendid thing to drive
    out mosquitoes. (<i>The pastille fizzes, and begins to emit a
    dense white smoke, and a suffocating odour.</i>)</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>bounding</i>). Mosquitoes! It would drive a
    <i>dragon</i> out. Phew&mdash;ah! (CULCHARD <i>closes the
    window.</i>) You <i>don't</i> mean to say you're going to shut
    me up in this infernal reek on a stifling night like this?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> If I didn't, the mosquitoes would come in
    again.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Come in? With that pastille doing the young
    Vesuvius! <i>Do</i> you think a mosquito's a born fool? (<i>He
    jumps out and opens the window.</i>) I'm not going to be smoked
    like a wasps' nest, <i>I</i> can tell you!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> See? I can <i>hear</i> one singing in my ear
    at this moment. (<i>Irritably.</i>) You <i>would</i> open the
    window!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>sleepily</i>). Not mosquitoes. I meant
    HYPATIA, and the&mdash;haw&mdash;yaw&mdash;TROTTERS.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> How can <i>I</i> tell? (<i>Second
    silence.</i>) PODBURY! What did I <i>tell</i> you? One's just
    bitten me&mdash;the <i>beast</i>! (<i>He turns on the light,
    and slaps about frantically</i>). I say, I can hear him buzzing
    all over the place!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> So can I hear <i>you</i> buzzing. How the
    dickens is a fellow to get to sleep while you're playing Punch
    and Judy in there?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> He's got me on the nose now! There's a lot
    outside. Just turn off the light, will you? I daren't put my
    arm out. (<i>To</i> Mosquito.) You brute! (<i>To</i> Podb.)
    PODBURY, <i>do</i> switch off the light&mdash;like a good
    fellow!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>dreamily</i>). Glass up, Gondolier ...
    stifling in this cab ... drive me ... nearest Doge. [<i>He
    snores.</i></p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Brutal selfishness! (<i>Turns out the light

    Here, wake up, PODBURY&mdash;it's just eight. (PODBURY <i>sits
    up, and rubs his eyes.</i>) I've had a <i>horrible</i> night,
    my dear fellow! I'm stung to such an extent! But
    (<i>hopefully</i>) I suppose there's nothing to <i>show</i>
    particularly, eh? [<i>Presenting his countenance for
    inspection.</i></p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Not much of your original features, old fellow!

    like a raised map!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> It&mdash;it's going <i>down</i>. Nothing to
    what it <i>was</i>, half an hour ago!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Then I'm jolly glad you didn't call me earlier,
    that's all!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> It does feel a little inflamed. I wonder if I
    could get a little&mdash;er&mdash;violet powder, or
    something&mdash;?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>with a painful want of sympathy</i>).
    Violet powder! Buy a blue veil&mdash;a good thick one!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> What sort of impression <i>do</i> you suppose
    I should get of Venice with a blue veil on?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Can't say&mdash;but a pleasanter one than
    Venice will get of you <i>without</i> it. You don't mean to
    face the fair Miss TROTTER while you're like <i>that</i>, do

    <h2>ONLY FANCY!</h2>

    <p>Members of the House of Commons have read with a thrill of
    interest Lord HENRY BRUCE's letter to his constituents,
    announcing his intention not to offer himself for re-election
    in North West Wilts. Full five years Lord HENRY has sat in the
    House. He has rarely joined in debate, but the manner of his
    occasional interposition was always notable. He slowly rose,
    placed one hand in his trousers' pocket, looked round the House
    and said nothing. Then, when the SPEAKER was about to call on
    someone else, Lord HENNY blurted forth a few sentences, the end
    generally coming first, and having apparently said about half
    what he meant to say, abruptly sat down. But the House, with
    keen instinct, always recognised the heaven-born orator, and
    knew his time would come. It has come with the opportunity of
    writing this letter, which is full of beautiful things. "I
    deprecated," says Lord HENRY, reviewing his distinguished
    Parliamentary career, "the surrendering of an ancient
    dependency like Heligoland, and which has since been strongly
    fortified, to satiate a shadowy claim of the GERMAN EMPEROR to
    the Island of Zanzibar." To satiate a shadowy claim is good.
    Space forbids quotation of more than one additional sentence
    from this masterpiece. "Let me conclude by saying, that I trust
    whoever may succeed me in North-West Wilts will wear ELIJAH's
    mantle with the same pleasure as I have already done." What
    that means no man can say.</p>

    <p>We are glad to learn that Lord HENRY BRUCE's retirement from
    Parliamentary life does not imply absolute withdrawal from
    public affairs. Since the appearance of his letter, there has
    been a rush upon him by able Editors and Magazines. He has
    undertaken to write to the <i>Twentieth Century</i> an Article
    on "Recent Ministerial Appointments." Mr. BOWEN ROWLANDS, M.P.,
    Q.C., has also been in communication with him. "The very man
    for the <i>Welsh Review</i>," says the enthusiastic Editor.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We learn from a reliable source that LORD HENRY BRUCE has
    intimated to Mr. AKERS-DOUGLAS that, in the event of his being
    selected to Move or Second the Address at the opening of the
    New Session, he will appear in Elijah's mantle. It is to be
    hoped Lord SALISBURY, offended, as he is understood to be, at
    Lord HENRY's frank criticism, will not ignore this proposal.
    The House of Commons will be much gratified to find itself
    relieved from the monotony of the uniform&mdash;alternately
    Militia Colonel and Post-Captain&mdash;which mars the success
    of an interesting ceremonial.</p>

    Spinster, but recent events at Cambridge make the use of the

            <p>Read THEODORE CHILD upon "Delicate Dining."</p>

            <p>This sage gastronomic full soothly doth say,</p>

            <p>That no mortal can dine more than once in the
            day;</p>

            <p>Then he quotes LOUIS QUINZE, that the art of the
            cook</p>

            <p>Must be learnt most from practice, and not from a
            book;</p>

            <p>While you also will find in the readable proem,</p>

            <p>Doctor KING said a dinner resembled a poem.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>We shall next see a cook can have only the
            dimmest</p>

            <p>Of notions of art, if he isn't a chemist.</p>

            <p>So we learn here the names and the separate uses</p>

            <p>Of muscular fibre, albumen and juices.</p>

            <p>We are shown the right methods of roasting and
            boiling,</p>

            <p>Of frying and stewing, decocting and broiling;</p>

            <p>While our author in words there can be no
            mistaking,</p>

            <p>Is dead against "roasting" in ovens&mdash;or
            baking.</p>

            <p>And a charming receipt for the <i>Sauce
            Hollandaise</i>.</p>

            <p>In England we know that in sauces we're weak,</p>

            <p>And we've never attained to the <i>cuisine
            classique</i>;</p>

            <p>But French Seigneurs of old gave full rein to their

            <p>We agree with the author who says when you dine,</p>

            <p>It is very much better to stick to one wine,</p>

            <p>Be it ruddy Bordeaux or the driest Champagne,</p>

            <p>Let the latter be cool but your ice is no gain.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>There is one line in our Mr. DU MAURIER's fascinating and
    fantastic novel, <i>Peter Ibbetson</i>, which every author
    should frame and hang up before his eyes in his study. 'Tis
    this, and 'tis to be found at page 217, Vol. ii.:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Write anyhow! Write for the greatest need and the
        greatest number."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>"This is business," quoth the Baron, "and <i>Peter</i> who
    passed so much of his life asleep seems, when not dreaming, to
    be uncommonly wide awake."</p>

    <p>A dainty book indeed for a Christmas present is <i>The
    Vision of Sir Launfal</i>, by JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL, published
    by GAY AND BIRD&mdash;lively names these&mdash;but ought to
    have been GAY AND LARK. There is an interesting portrait of the
    Author as he was in 1842.</p>

    <p>"My 'CO.,'" quoth the Baron, "deponeth thusly, as to
    Calendars generally,&mdash;not, however, including the one-eyed
    Kalendar of the Arabian Nights,&mdash;that MARCUS WARD, mark us
    well, comes out uncommonly strong, specially in the 'Boudoir'
    and also in the 'Shakspeare' Calendar, which latter hath for
    every day in the year 'a motto for every man.' Methinks this
    pretty well wipes off the Christmas score, which includes New
    Year gifts.</p>

    <p>"Now as to books,"&mdash;continues the Baron, "here let me
    say that my favourite pocket-books, not specially for
    Christmas, but for all times and seasons, are those excellent
    travelling companions provided by CASSELL's <i>National
    Library</i>, BRADBURY AND AGNEW's <i>Handy Volume Scott</i> and
    <i>Shakspeare</i>, and ROUTLEDGE's <i>Pocket Library</i>, all
    really portable, and printed in the clearest type. These be
    welcome presents to 'constant readers.'" The Baron presents his
    "many grateful thanks," to quote our worthy ROBSON ROOSTUM
    PASHA, to a kind friend, poet, scholar and judicious critic,
    who, from the North, sends the Baron a seasonable present of a
    small volume of poems, published by HOLDEN, of St. Andrew's,
    N.B. (Quoth Mr. WAGG, "quite a new 'un, published by a
    <i>h</i>old 'un"&mdash;<i>passons</i>), entitled <i>The Scarlet
    Gown</i>, written by Mr. R.F. MURRAY. His verses are in the
    Calverley vein, the rhyming and rhythm easy, the jingle
    pleasant, the lines witty, and the subjects fresh. The local
    hits will be specially appreciated by St. Andrew's men.
    Everyone will enjoy "The City of Golf, the Adventures of a
    Poet." Cantabs especially will sympathise with the humour of
    "The Delights of Mathematics." "So here's to the poet in the
    wassail bowl; a Happy New Year and a Murray Christmas to him,"
    says</p>

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
